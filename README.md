This project focuses on developing a lane detection system by combining traditional image processing techniques with machine learning for better accuracy. The system begins by identifying edges in road images using the Canny edge detection algorithm. These detected edges are then passed through the Hough Transform, which recognizes straight lines that represent lane markings.

To further enhance the accuracy of the lane detection, additional features, such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), are extracted. A Random Forest machine learning model is then trained to classify whether the lanes are present in the images. To improve the classification performance, the system also incorporates a neural network for evaluation and fine-tuning.

The system is tested on labeled datasets, with the results measured through key metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. By integrating edge detection, line detection, and machine learning techniques, the system becomes more effective at identifying lane boundaries, especially in complex driving conditions. This approach ultimately improves the reliability of lane detection in various roadÂ environments
